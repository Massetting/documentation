# The CEOS Open Data Cube Initiative


This white paper is meant to provide the background, purpose, vision and implementation steps required to achieve an Open Data Cube community that provides value to global satellite data users and increases the impact of satellite data.  

_Outline is below ... no more than 3-5 pages in the end, or people will NOT read it. Shorter is better._

## Background
Content from the FDA report and the Global Data Flows report that points toward Data Cubes ... How did we get to this point? Why do we need Data Cubes? Since 2007 we now have lots of free data, technology is moving rapidly, countries are developing, and they want satellite data! 

## Purpose
The world is gaining knowledge of the value of satellite data and they want to use it. This is evident through the success of Google Earth Engine and Amazon Web Services. The primary problems for users are data access, data preparation, and efficient analyses. Our purpose is to answer the needs of global users and this is what they commonly desire ... 

*	Users want to minimize the time and knowledge required to obtain and prepare satellite data
*	Users want free data and open source solutions.
*	Users want to perform time series analyses
*	Users want to use multiple datasets together
*	Users want to use their common GIS tools
*	Users want to “own” the data and keep it locally
* Users want customer service and help

## Vision
Our goal is to provide a *SOLUTION* that has *VALUE* and increase the *IMPACT* of satellite data.
Our goal is *NOT* to sell a product or give out a tool.

A solution supporting CEOS objectives …
*	Build capability of users to apply CEOS Agency data
*	Supporting priority CEOS/GEO agendas (UN-SDGs, Paris and Sendai)
CEOS Agencies wanting to participate …
*	Through provision of Analysis Ready Data (ARD) products.
*	Contributing to development and uptake of solution.
Customers feel that they are the focus … 
*	Training materials and easy installation/maintenance.
*	A “CEOS Open Data Cube” brand that people know and trust
Scalable solution …
*	Supporting Data Cubes in 20 countries by 2022.
*	Key partners (e.g. FAO, World Bank) back ODC projects.
An active Data Cube community …  
*	Users helping each other and open source contributions

## Implementation Steps
What are the steps needed to reach our goals? Build and sustain an Open Data Cube community based on ARD, open source tools, and customer support. 

* Develop instructions and scripts to obtain and/or produce ARD 
* Develop a simple Data Cube installation package and sample inputs/outputs
* Develop a Learning Center with documentation and training tools
* Create and manage an open source repository (Open Data Cube)
* Create a user forum that allows users to share ideas and "support themselves" 
* Obtain common application algorithms that are attractive to users (e.g. mosaics, water, forests, agriculture, change detection)
* Engage "other" organizations (e.g. World Bank, SERVIR) to identify country needs and provide infrastructure and funds to implement
* Conduct several CEOS-led pilot studies to test approaches and provide feedback
* Develop a group of globally distributed Python programmers who are able to support deployment and customer support

**Google Earth Engine (GEE) is a perfect analogy:** They have transformed the satellite data user 
community. What are they doing right? Very active user forums with fast responses to questions, frequent training workshops, listening to customers and giving them the information they want, removes burden of data preparation and yields rapid results. We need to duplicate many of these outcomes, but not their infrastructure.
**How can the CEOS Data Cube be different, but deliver what is important?** CEOS commitment to sustain and grow the ODC, enable local and regional deployment (users want data control), expanded datasets with provisions for ARD (key CEOS value-add, beyond GEE), proven methods for data interoperability (not often discussed in GEE), user interface tools (avoids need for user programming like GEE), customer service that goes beyond the standard user forum!

## Looking Ahead
What do we see as the **challenges** ... acceptance and scaleability. Will CEOS Agencies (and Working Groups) and the key stakeholders agree that this vision is achievable and worth contributing to? Do we have the required people, money and structures to reach our goals? How do we engage the "other" organizations to grow the number of countries using Data Cubes? How do we grow the user community to attract contributions and country expansion? 

CEOS is the ideal group to develop and sustain an Open Data Cube solution. CEOS has the data and we know how to produce ARD, CEOS has the connections with key international groups and stakeholders, and CEOS has proven it can work. Now we just need to go global.
